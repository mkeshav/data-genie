Welcome to data-genie's documentation!
======================================
Data genie is a library to fulfill your data wishes.
We all know how convenient and amazing practice it is to use
production data in test environments (what can go wrong).

Once you and your team realise all the things that can go wrong,
you would need something to generate production like data.
Data genie in combination with other libraries, like faker could be
quite powerful
